#These playbooks were made in order to run all Critical, Security and Update Rollups updates
until there are no more updates found. The 'main.yml' file is a ansible playbook that runs
locally. It calls the other 3 playbooks and will call them until there are no updates found.
This playbook has NOT been tested yet, therefore you should do it before using.
